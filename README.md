# web-scraping-wiki

This project is the result of learning with the **DQLab** course for data engineering. The code that was built was used for scraping with BeautifulSoup on one of the **Wikipedia** page, namely Demographics of Indonesia. The URL used is https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demografi_Indonesia.

This project aims to obtain information on the area and population of each province in Indonesia. The results are stored in a dataframe with the 'Nama Prov', 'Luas', 'Populasi 2010', and 'Populasi 2020' columns.
